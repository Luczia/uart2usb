# coregwUART

This is a CubeMX example to use a STM32 H723 as a bidirectional (3.3v) TTL UART <=> USB converter.
It was specifically optimized to transfer UART messages from a WitMotion IMU, but is could be adapted for other uses.

## Demo

## How to use

Install CubeMXIde and import this project


Plug in a WitMotion IMU to the STM32 board and un USB cable.
This demo uses the USB ports (PA11 and PA12) and the UART 7 (PE7 and PE8).
